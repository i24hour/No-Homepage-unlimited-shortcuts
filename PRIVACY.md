## 🔒 Your Privacy is Our Priority

iCTrL is designed with privacy in mind. We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All your data stays on your device.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

**We do NOT collect any personal information.**

iCTrL operates entirely locally on your browser. Here's what the extension stores locally on your device:

| Data Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Quick Links | The shortcut links you create (names and URLs) |
| RAM Saver Settings | Your preferences for auto-close timeout and protected domains |
| Tab Activity Data | Timestamps of when tabs were last active (for RAM Saver feature only) |

> **Important:** All data is stored using Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`) and never leaves your device. We have no servers, no databases, and no way to access your data.

---

## 2. Permissions Explained

iCTrL requires the following browser permissions to function:

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| `storage` | To save your quick links, settings, and preferences locally on your device |
| `tabs` | To track tab activity for the RAM Saver feature and open new tabs when you click shortcuts |
| `alarms` | To periodically check for inactive tabs (RAM Saver runs every minute in background) |

---

## 3. Data Sharing

**We do NOT share any data with third parties.**

- ❌ No analytics or tracking services
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No data brokers
- ❌ No external APIs (except Google Favicon API for displaying website icons)

---

## 4. Data Security

Your data is protected by Chrome's built-in security mechanisms:

- ✅ All data is stored in Chrome's sandboxed storage
- ✅ Only this extension can access its own stored data
- ✅ Data is tied to your Chrome profile and synced only if you enable Chrome Sync

---

## 5. Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

| Action | How |

| **Edit** | Modify or delete any shortcut at any time |
